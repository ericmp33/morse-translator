# morse-translator🔤📝🖥️
Welcome to the Morse-Latin & Latin-Morse translator, programmed with Java 16.

- How to run it?🤔<br>
  <a href="https://adoptium.net/?variant=openjdk16&jvmVariant=hotspot">Get Java☕</a> - build 16 or newer version and execute <a href="https://github.com/ericmp33/morse-translator/raw/main/out/artifacts/morse_translator_jar/morse-translator.jar">the jar</a>.

- Valid inputs✅<br>
  In this translator you can directly input your text to be translated. It decides if input is Morse or Latin and prints the proper translation. Note that you can't mix both languages. Input just Latin or just Morse. Also note that if the translator can't find the translation of one single letter/character, the whole input will be marked as invalid.
